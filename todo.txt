# TODO
## Major
- (feature) Improve sensitivity analysis (use Dakota?)
- (bug) Energy to create thermal plasma is very inaccurate when H2 begins to dissassociate (especially above 3000K)
- (bug) Fix the enthalpy of reaction calculations, doing something wrong. (Tests failing)

## Minor
- (feature) raise Exception if a dummy species is used in the mass / energy eval.
- (feature) Add concept of fixed operating costs. 
- (understand) How efficient is the condensing system? If it is inefficient, the hydrogen utilisation is important.
- (feature) use pathlib instead of os.path.join. Avoid explicit use of /tmp directory. Want to make this cross platform.
