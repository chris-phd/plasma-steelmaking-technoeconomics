- Clean up the LCOP.
- Include the methods that were used to calculate the capex.
- Add H2 storage, and how this adjusts the electricity cost. (or H2 cost?)

- The cost for MgO was taken from the cost of MgCO3

- Cost for injected carbon and graphite electodes are the same, but should
  be treated differently in the operating cost section..

- Fix the fluidized bed mass and energy flows to utilise all the
  devices.

- Fix the enthalpy of reaction calculations. (Tests failing)

- update the requirements.txt

- Add method to the Device / System class, to throw an error if the mass or 
  energy evaluation does not balance.
- raise Exception if a dummy species is used in the mass / energy eval.

- wortler2013, the source currently used for the capex of the fluidized beds,
  is actually originally for a shaft furnace. Can i find a source for the fluidized
  beds?
