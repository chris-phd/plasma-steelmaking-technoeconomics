# TODO
## Major
- Fix the enthalpy of reaction calculations. (Tests failing)
2 Fix the fluidized bed mass and energy flows to utilise all the
  devices.
- sensitivity analysis and error bars in plots.
- Add blast furnace with H2 injection for comparison.
  - Need to add the previous literature
  - Add BOF device to the blast furnace with H2 injection.
3 Add non-thermal plasma ironmaking
1 Understand the heat transfer efficiecy from the plasma to the ore.
  - how much gas do we need per kg of ore / dri?
  - break total plasma efficiency up into two numbers
  - total efficiency to the ore will be electrical-thermal efficiency + heat transfer efficiency.
- Plasma furnace should be able to operate with a mixture of Argon and H2...
- Add scrap pre-heating to the mass energy flow.

## Moderate
- wortler2013, the source currently used for the capex of the fluidized beds,
  is actually originally for a shaft furnace. Can i find a source for the fluidized
  beds?
- Add method to the Device / System class, to throw an error if the mass or 
  energy evaluation does not balance.
- raise Exception if a dummy species is used in the mass / energy eval.
- Validate the energy required to create the thermal plasma using factsage.
  - My code becomes very inaccurate when H2 begins to dissassociate.
- Compare the thermal plasma energy requirements to blast furnace energy requirements
  - Just use published data for the initial comparison, don't need to add BF energy flow.
- When setting the mass of a Mixture, distribute the mass equally based on the existing ratio 
  the species? Does it make sense to do this, or create nefarious bugs?
- Add the ore type and other important system_vars to the sim report...
- Need to be very clear about the difference between levelised capital cost and direct capex.
- add_plasma_flows_final: Need to calculate the reaction enthalpy from monotomic H reduction. The fraction of H reduction will depend on temp
- Add heat transfer efficiency to the plasma smelter and to the EAF.
  - This might be the main reason that my EAF system is so efficient.
  - WORK ON THIS AT THE START OF NEXT WEEK!!!

## Minor
- update the requirements.txt
- Cost for injected carbon and graphite electodes are the same, but should
  be treated differently in the operating cost section.
- The cost for MgO was taken from the cost of MgCO3
- report costs of the inputs in absolute terms.
- Move all the capex functions to the plant_costs.py file

## Bugs
- Energy to create the thermal plasma very inaccurate above 3000K.
  - Might be another good argument to try and incorporate cantera???
- The electricity requirement for the hybrid 33 pathway is very high..
  Why is this??

## Comments
- A big assumption here is that the steel plant is always running at full capacity.
- Electricity demand for all the major pathways is very similar at the commit:
  6fbfa30fbb2e0dfafb3364f7dff1129f1a7eff92
  Seems that the main difference is that we assume all the energy from the plasma is 
  perfectly transferred to the iron bearing material, and the heat exchanger does not
  suffer from maximum temperature problems..

- Possibly lower the steel bath temperature to 1600C, rather than
  1650, to match the phase diagrams.
