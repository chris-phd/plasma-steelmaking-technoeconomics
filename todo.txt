# TODO
## Major
- (feature) Improve sensitivity analysis (use Dakota?)
- (bug) Energy to create thermal plasma is very inaccurate when H2 begins to dissassociate (especially above 3000K)
- (bug) Fix the enthalpy of reaction calculations, doing something wrong. (Tests failing)
- (bug) verify that injected o2 and feo% in slag is being correctly accounted for in eaf and plasma systems.
- (feature) remove the ore heater, or make it optional. Don't think we can assume this exists in a real system. 

## Minor
- (feature) raise Exception if a dummy species is used in the mass / energy eval.
- (feature) Add concept of fixed operating costs. 
- (understand) How efficient is the condensing system? If it is inefficient, the hydrogen utilisation is important.
- (feature) use pathlib instead of os.path.join. Avoid explicit use of /tmp directory. Want to make this cross platform. 
- (feature) use the baur glassner diagram to set the initial excess h2 ratio in the direct reduction stages.
