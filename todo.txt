#TODO
## Major
- Fix the enthalpy of reaction calculations. (Tests failing)
- Fix the fluidized bed mass and energy flows to utilise all the
  devices.
- Add H2 storage 
  - How this adjusts the electricity cost. (or H2 cost?)
  - ASK JOHN OR ALI
- sensitivity analysis and error bars in plots.
- Add non-thermal plasma ironmaking
- Understand the heat transfer efficiecy from the plasma to the ore.
  - how much gas do we need per kg of ore / dri?
  - break total plasma efficiency up into two numbers
  - total efficiency to the ore will be electrical-thermal efficiency + heat transfer efficiency.

## Moderate
- wortler2013, the source currently used for the capex of the fluidized beds,
  is actually originally for a shaft furnace. Can i find a source for the fluidized
  beds?
- Add method to the Device / System class, to throw an error if the mass or 
  energy evaluation does not balance.
- raise Exception if a dummy species is used in the mass / energy eval.
- Validate the energy required to create the thermal plasma using factsage.
- Compare the thermal plasma energy requirements to blast furnace energy requirements
  - Just use published data for the initial comparison, don't need to add BF energy flow.
- When setting the mass of a Mixture, distribute the mass equally based on the existing ratio 
  the species? Does it make sense to do this, or create nefarious bugs?
- Add the ore type and other important system_vars to the sim report...
- Need to be very clear about the difference between levelised capital cost and direct capex.
- All electricitiy consuming devices should be able to utilise spot prices for some fraction of thier electricity.
  - Could just make 'base electricity' distribute between cheap and expensive electricity at the point
    where the prices are calculated.

## Minor
- update the requirements.txt
- Cost for injected carbon and graphite electodes are the same, but should
  be treated differently in the operating cost section..
- The cost for MgO was taken from the cost of MgCO3
- report costs of the inputs in absolute terms.

## Bugs
- Energy to create the thermal plasma very inaccurate above 3000K.
  - Might be another good argument to try and incorporate cantera???

## Comments
- A big assumption here is that the steel plant is always running at full capacity.
